# Fuzz-Pedal

The fuzz guitar pedal produces a distorted sound, hence the name fuzz pedal. To achieve this effect, two common emitter transistors are connected in a cascade. Both transistors ahve their emitter regions grounded. 
In this project I am using PNP transistors, but NPN transistors can be substituted with modifications to the circuit of course.
